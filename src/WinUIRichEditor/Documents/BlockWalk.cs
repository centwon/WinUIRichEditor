/// <summary>The document's canonical block order — the one thing four separate walks used to each

/// <para><c>RichEditor.ParagraphsInBlocks</c>, <c>TextRange.CollectParagraphs</c>,
/// <c>TextPointer.CompareTo</c>'s walk and <c>UndoManager.WalkParagraphs</c> all produced this order,
/// and their comments read "Mirror of the control's ParagraphsInBlocks", "Mirrors the editor's
/// ParagraphsInBlocks order", "mirroring CollectParagraphs". That is four copies held in agreement by
/// nothing but a request to whoever edits them next — and it has already failed once: TextPointer's own
/// comment records that without the recursion "a pointer inside a nested or inline table kept index -1
/// and selections spanning one compared as equal/reversed".</para>
/// <para>Order, and why each part of it matters:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>A <see cref="Paragraph"/> comes before the cell content of any inline table it hosts — the
/// paragraph is where the caret sits, the cells hang off it.</item>
/// <item>A <see cref="TableBlock"/> itself takes one position before its cells, which keeps the
/// historical index numbering that <see cref="TextPointer"/> comparisons and undo caret restoration
/// both depend on.</item>
/// <item>Cells are visited through <see cref="TableBlock.LogicalCells"/> — anchors only, row-major.
/// A covered (merged-away) cell is not content and must not take a position, or index-based range
/// loops disagree with the editor about merged tables.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>Every block is yielded exactly once, so a consumer that wants global indices just counts what
/// it pulls, and one that wants paragraphs filters. Lazy: consumers that stop early (a comparison that
/// has located both endpoints, a containment test) stop the walk.</para></summary>
